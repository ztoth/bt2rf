## Bluetooth to RF converter

This project converts commands received over the bluetooth modem to RF 434MHz signals. I use it
to drive a set of Etekcity remote controlled outlets from laptop/phone. I captured the codes
with an RF 434MHz receiver and hardcoded them. The project runs on an Arduino Pro Mini with a
SparkFun Bluetooth Mate modem.
